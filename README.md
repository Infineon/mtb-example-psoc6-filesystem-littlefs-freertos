# PSoC&trade; 6 MCU: littlefs Filesystem

This example uses the Arm&reg; Cortex&reg;-M4 (CM4) CPU of PSoC&trade; 6 MCU to execute a [littlefs filesystem](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) task.

At device reset, the default Cortex-M0+ (CM0+) application enables the CM4 CPU and configures the CM0+ CPU to go to sleep. The CM4 CPU mounts the filesystem on the storage device, reads a 32-bit value from a file, increments the value, writes the value back to the file, and finally prints the value to the UART terminal. You will see the value incrementing after every reset. The storage device can be either an SD card or a QSPI NOR flash.

This example uses the [mtb-littlefs](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-littlefs) middleware library that implements the littlefs-compatible block device drivers for different storage devices such as SD card and NOR flash.

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-psoc6-filesystem-littlefs-freertos](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-psoc6-filesystem-littlefs-freertos)" application with the desired name "FilesystemLittlefs" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-filesystem-littlefs-freertos --user-app-name FilesystemLittlefs --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```
The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

The CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT, CY8CKIT-062-BLE, CYW9P62S1-43438EVB-01, CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W and CY8CKIT-062S4 kits does not support SD card as the storage device. By default, the kit is configured to work in the NOR flash as storage device (ensure that the `STORAGE_DEVICE_SD_CARD` macro in the main.c is set to `0`).

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Littlefs File System on SD Card and QSPI NOR Flash" is displayed on the UART terminal. When the application is run for the first time, mounting the filesystem might result in error in which case the memory is formatted and then the filesystem is mounted.

   **Figure 1. First time mounting of littlefs**

   ![](images/littlefs-first-mount.png)

5. Now, press the reset button on the kit and observe that the `boot_count` is incremented.

   **Figure 2. Boot count incremented after reset**

   ![](images/littlefs-press-reset.png)

6. If you press the User button on the kit, the memory will be formatted and the `boot_count` will be reset. You can press the reset button to increment the `boot_count` again.

   **Figure 3. Formatting on user button press**

   ![](images/littlefs-press-user-button.png)

7. By default, the application uses the QSPI NOR flash as the storage device. To change the storage device to the SD card, set the value of the macro `STORAGE_DEVICE_SD_CARD` in *main.c* to `1` and then build the application and program the kit.


## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

<mark> Add the below Note for relevant CEs only, like PSoC 6 MCU based. Remove this note for others.

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by retarget-io for debug UART port  |
| GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_BTN         | User button                  |
| SDHC (HAL) | sdhc_obj | Communication with the SD card |
| QSPI (HAL) | qspi_obj | Communication with the QSPI NOR flash |

This example uses the [littlefs](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) filesystem API to perform simple file open/read/write operations and to retain a 32-bit data in non-volatile storage devices such as SD card and NOR flash. This example relies on the [mtb-littlefs](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-littlefs) library that implements the block device drivers for use with littlefs.

This example uses the NOR flash as storage device by default. You can change it to the SD card by setting the value of `STORAGE_DEVICE_SD_CARD` to `1` in *main.c*. In this example, CM4 runs a FreeRTOS task that does the following:

1. Mounts the filesystem. If mounting fails, formats the storage device and mounts again.
2. Opens a file, reads a 32-bit data, increments the value, writes the data into the file, and closes the file
3. Displays the incremented data on the UART terminal
4. Waits for user action
5. If the User button is pressed, formats the storage device

This example sets `COMPONENTS=RTOS_AWARE` in the Makefile so that the low-level drivers such as the SDHC HAL enables RTOS-related features. For example, SDHC HAL waits on a semaphore until a read transfer completes. This example also sets `DEFINES=LFS_THREADSAFE` to enable thread-safety in a multi-threaded environment.
